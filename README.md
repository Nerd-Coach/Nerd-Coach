- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Nerd-Coach
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in coding and programming. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to code in C.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am a Science teacher and Football coach in Arkansas.  Learning this to expand my knowledge and hopefully help ignite interests in students to use computer science in the classroom as an extension to their regular education.
